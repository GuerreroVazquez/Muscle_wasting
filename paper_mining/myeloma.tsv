To find a novel target for anticancer therapy- the UPS has been an active area of research since the FDA"s first approval of a proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in 2003 for treating multiple myeloma (MM). Here- we summarize newly described UPS components- including E3 ubiquitin ligases- deubiquitinases (DUBs)- and immunoproteasome- whose malfunction leads to tumorigenesis and whose inhibitors have been investigated in clinical trials as anticancer therapy since 2020. We explain the mechanism and effects of several inhibitors in depth to better comprehend the advantages of targeting UPS components for cancer treatment. In addition- we describe attempts to overcome resistance and limited efficacy of some launched proteasome inhibitors- as well as an emerging PROTAC-based tool targeting UPS components for anticancer therapy.", "0"

Although cytokines can augment CAR T cell proliferation- systemically administered cytokines can result in toxicities. To gain the benefits of cytokine signaling while mitigating toxicities- we designed constitutively active synthetic cytokine receptor chimeras (constitutive Turbodomains) that signal in a CAR T cell-specific manner. The modular design of Turbodomains enables diverse cytokine signaling outputs from a single homodimeric receptor chimera and allows multiplexing of different cytokine signals. Turbodomains containing an IL-2/15RÎ²-derived signaling domain closely mimicked IL-15 signaling and enhanced CAR T cell potency. Allogeneic TurboCAR T cells targeting BCMA showed no evidence of aberrant proliferation yet displayed enhanced expansion and antitumor activity- prolonging survival and preventing extramedullary relapses in mouse models. These results illustrate the potential of constitutive Turbodomains to achieve selective potentiation of CAR T cells and demonstrate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic BCMA TurboCAR T cells- supporting clinical evaluation in multiple myeloma.", "0"

Google Trends (GT)- a popular tool- allows the exploration of public interest in health-related phenomena. Despite the growing volume of GT studies- none have focused explicitly on oncology- creating a need for a systematic review to bridge this gap.", "0"
